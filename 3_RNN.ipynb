       "{'text': ['I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",
       "  '\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn\\'t matter what one\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\'t true. I\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women\\'s bodies.'],\n",

    "* How does stochastic gradient descent work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple yet very efficient approach to fitting linear models. It is particularly useful when the number of samples (and the number of features) in the data is very large. SGD has been successfully applied to large-scale and sparse machine learning problems often encountered in text classification and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind SGD is to take a few training examples (a mini-batch) at a time and update the model parameters after each mini-batch. The update is performed in the direction that minimizes the objective function. The objective function in logistic regression is the negative log-likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update rule for the model parameters in SGD is:\n",
    "\n",
    "w = w - learning_rate * gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "where w is the vector of model parameters and gradient is the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters. The learning_rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the model parameters are updated after each mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of SGD over other optimization methods is that it can be used to train models in an online fashion. This means that the model can be updated after each new training example is seen. This is particularly useful when the training data is too large to fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the role of the learning rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate is a parameter that controls how much the weights of the logistic regression model are updated in each iteration. A higher learning rate means that the weights are updated more frequently, which can lead to faster convergence, but it can also lead to overfitting. A lower learning rate means that the weights are updated less frequently, which can lead to slower convergence, but it can also help to avoid overfitting.\n",

    "The skip-gram method of Word2Vec is a neural network that takes in a word and outputs a vector representation of that word. The vector representation is learned by the neural network through a process of training on a large corpus of text. The training process involves the neural network seeing a word and then predicting the surrounding words in the context of that word. The neural network is then able to learn the vector representation of a word by looking at the context in which it appears.\n",

    "* How does it uses the fact that two words appearing in similar contexts are likely to have similar meanings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec uses a neural network to learn the vector representations of words in a corpus. The neural network is trained to predict the next word in a sequence, and the hidden layer of the network encodes the vector representations of the words. The vectors for similar words are close together in the vector space, and the distance between the vectors can be used to measure the similarity between the words."

    "RNNs are a type of neural network where the output from the previous timestep is fed as input to the current timestep. This creates a direct connection between the timesteps, which allows the network to learn temporal dependencies. LSTMs are a type of RNN that uses a special type of cell that can learn long-term dependencies.\n",

    "LSTMs are trying to solve the problem of long-term dependencies in basic RNNs. Basic RNNs have a hard time learning from data that has long-term dependencies because they forget information from previous inputs as they process new inputs. LSTMs are designed to overcome this problem by using a memory cell that can remember information for long periods of time."
